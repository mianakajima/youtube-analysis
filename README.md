# Characterising Youtube Trending Vidoes

- Data is from the kaggle data set ["Youtube Trending Video Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset). 
    - The `US_youtube_trending_data.csv` and `US_category_id.json` files were downloaded from the above link and saved in a `data` folder. The files are not uploaded to this repository due to file size being large. 
    - The [intermediary_data](https://github.com/mnakaj/youtube-analysis/tree/main/analysis/intermediary_data) folder contains cleaned data from the above files.
- Exploratory analysis is done in the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/mnakaj/youtube-analysis/blob/main/analysis/youtube_EDA.ipynb).
